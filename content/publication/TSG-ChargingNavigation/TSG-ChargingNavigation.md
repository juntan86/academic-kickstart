abstract = "This paper proposes an integrated electric vehicle (EV) charging navigation framework, which takes into consideration the impacts from both the power system and transportation system. The proposed framework links the power system with transportation system through the charging navigation of massive EVs. It benefits the two systems by attracting EVs to charge at off-peak hours and saving the time of EV owners with real-time navigation. Based on the formulated framework, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to effectively navigate EVs to electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). At the upper level of the hierarchical game, a non-cooperative game is proposed to model the competition between EVCSs. Based on the pricing strategies obtained from the non-cooperative game, multiple evolutionary games are formulated at the lower level to evolve EVs' strategies in choosing EVCSs. The simulation results show that the proposed integrated charging navigation approach is effective in improving both the reliability of the power distribution grid and economic profits of the charging stations."
